# Titanic project

The classic machine learning problem, trying to predict which passengers would survive the Titanic disaster.

This was my first Data project, and at the end of the 3.0 version, I accomplished an accuracy of 78.5%, with a KNN model.
Version 1.0 is really bad and rudimentar, with barely any EDA and Feature Engineering, but returned an accuracy value of 76%.
Version 2.0, I tried some EDA and Feature Engineering. Even though I felt the models were more robust, I only achieved an accuracy value of 74%, lower than Version 1.0.
Version 3.0, I really applied myself on Feature Engineering, venturing through the data, and got a slight improvement on the accuracy.

Even though it might not seem much, with Version 1.0 I was ranked 10000 out of 15000 participants; with Version 3.0, I was ranked 2000.

There could be some more improvements, but unfortunately I am not experienced enough. Who knows, one day I might revisit the problem, hopefully achieving 80+ % accuracy.
